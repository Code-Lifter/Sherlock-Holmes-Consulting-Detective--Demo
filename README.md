I'm a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective (SHCD) games, and I'm working on a website using the free demo case.

If people are interested, I might create more sites based on other fan-made cases.

I've always found the physical edition a bit frustrating. Even when I try to play as intended, my eyes tend to wander as I flip through the case book. I end up thinking, "Ooh, that's a long paragraph with a picture, I think I'll jump there," which kind of ruins the experience. I've often wished the physical version had a system like the "Detective: A Modern Crime Board Game", with separate dialogue cards and a separate pile of numbered picture clues.

Just to be clear, I'm not planning to replicate the actual cases in the full boxed game. That would be unethical and diminish the value of the physical edition. I also want to respect copyright and avoid taking any revenue away from the talented developers who create these high-quality games.
